## ‚ö°Ô∏è`ato` Code Examples

### Simple Examples:

#### Voltage Divider
```python
from "generics/resistors.ato" import Resistor

module VoltageDivider:
    signal top
    signal out
    signal bottom

    r_top = new Resistor
    r_top.package = "R0402"

    r_bottom = new Resistor
    r_bottom.package = "0402"

    top ~ r_top.p1; r_top.p2 ~ out
    out ~ r_bottom.p1; r_bottom.p2 ~ bottom

    r_total: resistance
    v_in: voltage
    v_out: voltage
    i_q: current

    assert v_in * r_bottom.value / (r_top.value + r_bottom.value) within v_out
    assert v_in / (r_bottom.value + r_top.value) within i_q
```

#### RP2040 Blinky Circuit
```python
import RP2040Kit from "rp2040/RP2040Kit.ato"
import LEDIndicatorRed from "generics/leds.ato"
import LDOReg3V3 from "regulators/regulators.ato"
import USBCConn from "usb-connectors/usb-connectors.ato"

module Blinky:
    micro_controller = new RP2040Kit
    led_indicator = new LEDIndicatorRed
    voltage_regulator = new LDOReg3V3
    usb_c_connector = new USBCConn

    usb_c_connector.power ~ voltage_regulator.power_in
    voltage_regulator.power_out ~ micro_controller.power
    micro_controller.gpio13 ~ led_indicator.input
    micro_controller.power.gnd ~ led_indicator.gnd

    led_indicator.v_in = 3.3volt +/-10%
```

### Full Projects

## üî® Getting Started

Find our [documentation](https://atopile.io/getting-started/) and getting started [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aeZLlA_VYA).

`atopile` is on pypi.org: https://pypi.org/project/atopile/


### Most Basic Installation

`atopile` requires *python3.11* or later, which you can install using your package manager or from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then just `pip install atopile` and you're good to go!


### Open in Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/vrtnis/atopile)


To streamline your development process with atopile, consider using Gitpod, a pre-configured cloud-based development environment that runs directly in your browser. Here are some of the key benefits of using Gitpod with atopile:

- **Zero Setup Time**: Launch into coding with atopile immediately, without any installation hassles. Everything from the atopile compiler, atopile VSCode extension to necessary dependencies is set up and ready as soon as you open your Gitpod workspace.

- **Consistent Development Environment**: Each Gitpod workspace ensures that all team members are working with identical software setups. This consistency dramatically reduces "works on my machine" issues, facilitating smoother collaborations and integration testing.

- **Pre-Built Workspaces**: Gitpod continuously pre-builds your Git repositories based on the latest commits. When you start a new session, Gitpod quickly prepares your environment by pulling in all required dependencies and pre-compiling your atopile projects, so you can dive straight into productive work without delay.

- **Accessible from Anywhere**: With Gitpod, your development environment is as portable as your web browser. Whether you're on a laptop, a tablet, or even a borrowed machine, you can access your atopile projects with full setup instantly from anywhere.

- **Seamless Integration with Version Control Systems**: Gitpod integrates directly with GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. Start a new workspace for any branch, issue, or pull request with just a single click right from your repository.


## ‚ùì Why Atopile?

The objective of atopile is to help push forward these paradigms from the software world to hardware, mainly these points:

* **Intelligent Design Capture**: Define hardware specifications like ratios and tolerances in code, enabling precise control and easy reuse of designs.
* **Version Control Integration**: Use git to manage design changes, facilitating collaboration and ensuring each iteration is thoroughly reviewed and validated.
* **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Implement CI to guarantee high-quality, compliant designs with every commit, represented by a green checkmark for assurance.

Describing hardware with code might seem odd at first glance. But once you realize it introduces software development paradigms and toolchains to hardware design, you'll be hooked, just like we've become.

Code can **capture the intelligence** you put into your work. Imagine configuring not the resistance values of a voltage divider, but its ratio and total resistance, all using **physical units** and **tolerances**. You can do this because someone before you described precisely what this module is and described the relationships between the values of the components and the function you care about. Now instead imagine what you can gain from **reusing** a buck design you can merely **configure** the target voltage and ripple of. Now imagine **installing** a [servo drive](https://github.com/atopile/spin-servo-drive) the same way you might numpy.

Version controlling your designs using **git** means you can deeply **validate** and **review** changes a feature at a time, **isolated** from impacting others' work. It means you can detangle your organisation and **collaborate** on an unprecedented scale. We can forgo half-baked "releases" in favor of stamping a simple git-hash on our prototypes, providing an anchor off which to **associate test data** and expectations.

Implementing CI to **test** our work ensures both **high-quality** and **compliance**, all summarised in a green check mark, emboldening teams to target excellence.
